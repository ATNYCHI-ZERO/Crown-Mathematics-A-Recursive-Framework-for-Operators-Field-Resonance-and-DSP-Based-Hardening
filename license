License Options and Trade-offs

Crown Ω Math is described as a cutting-edge mathematical framework with applications in AI, cryptography, and defense systems
encyclopedia.pub
. Its developers need a license that encourages open research contributions but blocks unauthorized or malicious use (e.g. by adversarial actors or in unethical AI systems). No standard OSS license perfectly fits these needs, so we compare common options:

Permissive Licenses (MIT/BSD/Apache 2.0): These allow anyone to use, modify and redistribute the code for any purpose
en.wikipedia.org
en.wikipedia.org
. For example, the MIT License “puts few restrictions on reuse”
en.wikipedia.org
 and Apache 2.0 “allows users to use the software for any purpose… to distribute it, to modify it”
en.wikipedia.org
 (with an added patent grant
en.wikipedia.org
). The advantage is maximum openness and ease of contribution, but the downside is that any actor, including malicious ones, could use the code without limitation. Permissive licenses have no field-of-use or ethical restrictions, so they cannot stop a bad actor or military contractor from employing the framework. In short, permissive licensing maximizes adoption but offers no mechanism to block misuse.

Copyleft Licenses (GPLv3, AGPLv3): These require derived works to remain open-source (“viral” effect), ensuring that improvements are shared. This helps community contributions but still places no limits on who may use the software or for what purpose. In fact, by definition a GPL (or AGPL) license “may not restrict anyone from using the software in a specific field of endeavor”
opensource.stackexchange.com
. (GPL’s share-alike terms simply ensure freedom of redistribution, not ethical use.) One answer notes that any clause “not to be used by industry X” would make a license incompatible with the GPL
softwareengineering.stackexchange.com
. Thus, GPL/AGPL cannot legally forbid “bad” uses, and any attempt to add such a clause would conflict with the Open Source Definition
opensource.stackexchange.com
. In practice, many projects use GPL/AGPL under a dual-license model: code is GPL for research/community use, while enterprises obtain a separate paid license. This is precisely because strong copyleft (“AGPL/GPL impos[e] many conditions”) tends to push commercial users to a proprietary license
fossa.com
. (For example, a company might open-source a core algorithm under AGPL but require a commercial license for any product use.)

Proprietary (Closed) License: A proprietary EULA or commercial license offers full control. You can explicitly forbid any use you choose (e.g. only license “approved” parties, block specific fields of use, etc.). That would let you legally bar malicious or unauthorized uses. However, proprietary licensing closes the code to the community: contributions would be limited by NDAs or contribution agreements, and trust may suffer. It also conflicts with the desire for “open-source or research contributions” unless you set up a complex permission system. Proprietary is safest for control, but sacrifices openness.

Ethical / “Moral” Licenses: In recent years some projects have tried adding ethics clauses. For example, the Hippocratic License 3.0 explicitly requires compliance with human-rights norms
firstdonoharm.dev
, and the (in)famous JSON license adds “The Software shall be used for Good, not Evil”
json.org
. These licenses aim to block malicious applications, but by design they violate the Open Source Definition (discriminating by use or person
opensource.stackexchange.com
). Hippocratic License’s authors even acknowledge it “does not conform” to OSI open-source criteria
firstdonoharm.dev
. In practice, such clauses are hard to enforce: one answer notes that JSON’s “good not evil” line caused corporate users to demand special permission (and Google removed JSON tools for not being free)
opensource.stackexchange.com
json.org
. Another example is the Just World License, which tries to keep code out of the hands of organizations seen as unethical
softwareengineering.stackexchange.com
. These ethical licenses put a clear moral statement into the license, but they are legally novel and often treated as non-free. They do allow restricting malicious use in principle, but at the cost of abandoning standard open-source compatibility and risking confusion.

Summary Comparison:

MIT/Apache: Permissive, easy contributions, no use restrictions
en.wikipedia.org
en.wikipedia.org
.

GPL/AGPL: Copyleft for contributions, no use restrictions
opensource.stackexchange.com
.

Proprietary: Total control (including “no military/commercial use”), but not open.

Ethical (custom): Defines forbidden uses explicitly (e.g. JSON’s “Good not Evil”
json.org
, Hippocratic’s human-rights clauses
firstdonoharm.dev
), but not OSI-approved and hard to enforce.

The conventional open licenses (MIT/GPL/Apache) cannot by themselves limit malicious use. If the top priority is to prevent unauthorized or unethical deployments, some form of custom restriction is needed. In practice, many sensitive projects use a dual-licensing strategy: publish the code under a strong copyleft (like AGPL) to harness community work, but require a separate negotiated license for sensitive or commercial use
fossa.com
. This way, anyone can study and contribute to the code under open terms, but any “production” use (especially by enterprises or government) is subject to the author’s approval.

Recommended Approach

Given the above, the best fit is likely a custom or dual-license solution rather than a stock MIT/GPL copy. One practical model is:

Open Research License: Publish the Crown Ω code under a copyleft license (e.g. AGPLv3). This ensures open access and contributions, and forces any distributed derivative work to remain open
fossa.com
. AGPL also mandates sharing modifications even when the software is run as a service, further spreading improvements.

Usage Restrictions Clause: Augment that license with explicit field-of-use restrictions. For example, the license could state that permitted uses are limited to non-commercial, academic, governmental, or defense research approved by the author, and explicitly prohibit malicious activities. (This is not open-source by OSI, but it meets the project’s goals.) For instance, similar licenses phrase this as no license is granted for disallowed uses – e.g. the OCB encryption patent license explicitly states “no license is granted for any Military Use”
softwareengineering.stackexchange.com
. The Crown Ω license could analogously forbid “any unauthorized or malicious use” (such as in autonomous lethal weapons, unlawful surveillance, or other human-rights abuses). You might model language on the JSON license’s simple clause (“Good not Evil”
json.org
) or Hippocratic’s human-rights standards
firstdonoharm.dev
.

Commercial/Enterprise License: Require any other use (especially commercial deployment or unvetted defense use) to be governed by a separate proprietary agreement. In other words, enterprise or mission-critical users must negotiate a paid license or an NDA with the licensor. This is common in dual-license projects: the open AGPL option is attractive for non-profit research, while organizations wanting to use the code outside that scope sign a commercial contract.

This hybrid approach balances openness and control. It allows the community to contribute (via the AGPL-backed public code) while giving the author final say on sensitive applications. Crucially, it embeds a “kill switch” in the license: violation of the ethical terms automatically terminates the license, making any such use infringing.

Sample License Language (illustrative):

“Crown Ω Math Framework License v1.0
Copyright (c) [Year] Crown Labs.

Grant of Rights: Subject to these terms, the Licensor grants you a perpetual, worldwide license to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software for non-commercial research, educational, and governmental purposes only. All modifications or derivative works must be released under the same license.

Restricted Uses: No rights are granted for any use that is unauthorized or malicious. Specifically, this software may NOT be used to develop or deploy autonomous weapons systems, conduct illegal surveillance, facilitate cyber-attacks on critical infrastructure, or otherwise violate human rights or public safety. For any commercial, defense, or other use outside the above scope, you must obtain a separate license from Licensor.

Termination: This license automatically terminates if you breach any term above (e.g. by using the software for a prohibited purpose). Unauthorized use after termination is infringement. Licensor reserves all rights not expressly granted.

Disclaimer: THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY. (Include standard warranty disclaimer.)”

This sample is adapted from existing models: it uses a GPL/AGPL-style copyleft grant (akin to MIT/Apache wording
en.wikipedia.org
en.wikipedia.org
) but adds explicit “Restricted Uses” like ethical licenses do. The prohibition is unambiguous (similar in spirit to the JSON license’s “Good not Evil” line
json.org
 or the OCB license’s “no Military Use” clause
softwareengineering.stackexchange.com
).

Rationale:

Ethical Control: By naming forbidden activities (e.g. “autonomous weapons”, “human rights abuses”), the license aims to deter malicious actors and set clear boundaries. It leverages licensing (and copyright enforcement) to police use, much like Hippocratic or JSON licenses attempt
firstdonoharm.dev
json.org
.

Open Contribution: Requiring derivatives to remain under this license (copyleft) or at least requiring sharing (AGPL) ensures research contributions flow back, while still allowing free academic/government use.

Commercial Safeguard: The separate-license clause covers high-stakes deployments. Organizations using the framework outside research must contact the author, preserving legal recourse and compliance checks. (This echoes dual-license practices where AGPL “drives” enterprise use toward a paid license
fossa.com
.)

Caveats: Note that any use-based restriction means the license is no longer “open source” by strict definitions
firstdonoharm.dev
opensource.stackexchange.com
. If strict OSI compliance is essential, the only alternatives would be to keep the license purely open (MIT/Apache/GPL) and rely on separate legal measures (like patents or export controls) to control misuse. However, most jurisdictions allow copyright licensors to set such terms in EULAs. The proposed custom license explicitly embraces these restrictions to meet Crown Ω’s goals, even though that means it’s a “non-open” license. Given the sensitivities around recursive AI and defense use, this tradeoff may be justified to retain control.

Conclusion: In sum, no standard OSS license fully meets Crown Ω’s needs. A custom/dual license – combining a copyleft open license for research with strict field-of-use restrictions and a commercial license option – best balances openness with control. The final license should explicitly forbid unauthorized or malicious use (borrowing proven phrasing
softwareengineering.stackexchange.com
json.org
) and require any major deployments to be separately licensed. This approach (while nontraditional) aligns with the framework’s ethical and security requirements and has precedents in both dual-licensing practices

 and ethical licensing efforts
